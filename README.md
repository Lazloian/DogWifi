# DogWifi

Project for tracking the movement of my dog using an esp32 and accelerometer. Data sent to raspberry pi connected to wifi, read through node-red, and displayed using graphana. A custom pcb was made for the the electrical components and a case was designed and 3D printed to attach to the collar.
